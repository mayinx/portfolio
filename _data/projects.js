And my first attempt to set something up like an React App Template Folder Structure (Work in Prgress). Features: Infinite scroll + dynamic list filtering per api calls (per status (alive, dead, unknown), per species (human, alien)) + text serach by character name - snappy filert and search bar -  and not to forget: an incredibly (voluntarily) overdone scale effect on hover over the character cards, to 'increase the horror' - muhahha... - I learned that a search for characters named chris or similar produced intersting charcters!
