Really a fun one - unfortunately not enough time to implement responsiveness, multipe boards, drag 'n drop and, what, not, etc. - I'm definetively going to revisit this one. If it weren't for Edemda, I would have choosen to extend Bello as Capstone-Project, but no, it must be the hard way...",

        "Integrating with an API Backend - Another fun weekend project for the neuefische-Bootcamp. And my first attempt to set something up like an React App Template Folder Structure (Work in Prgress). Features: Infinite scroll + dynamic list filtering per api calls (per status (alive, dead, unknown), per species (human, alien)) + text serach by character name - snappy filert and search bar -  and not to forget: an incredibly (voluntarily) overdone scale effect on hover over the character cards, to 'increase the horror' - muhahha... - I learned that a search for characters named chris or similar produced intersting charcters!
